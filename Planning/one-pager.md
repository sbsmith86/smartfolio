# **SmartFolio**
## *The Intelligence-First Professional Platform*

### **The Problem**
Your professional story is scattered across resumes, GitHub repos, LinkedIn profiles, project documentation, and testimonials. When someone wants to understand your career journey, they have to piece together fragments from multiple sources. **Professionals need a unified way to present their complete story that people can actually explore and understand conversationally.**

### **The Solution**
SmartFolio transforms all your professional data into one intelligent, conversational profile. Upload your resume, connect your GitHub and LinkedIn, add project documentation and testimonials—SmartFolio's AI creates a comprehensive knowledge base about your career. Instead of static profiles, visitors can have natural conversations with your professional history: *"Tell me about Sarah's experience with distributed systems"* or *"What projects has John led that involved machine learning?"*

### **How It Works**

**For You (The Professional):**
1. **Feed Everything In**: Upload your resume, connect GitHub/LinkedIn profiles, add project documentation, testimonials, certifications, portfolio pieces
2. **AI Integration**: Tiger MCP automatically extracts, structures, and connects all your professional data into a unified knowledge base
3. **Conversational Profile**: Your career becomes explorable through natural conversation—visitors can ask about specific projects, technologies, experiences
