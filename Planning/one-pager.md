# **SmartFolio**
## *The Intelligence-First Professional Platform*

### **The Problem**
LinkedIn has become a social media platform cluttered with influencer content and engagement farming. Recruiters spend hours manually scanning profiles, missing qualified candidates. Job seekers struggle to surface their true capabilities beyond keyword-stuffed profiles. **The professional world needs a platform that prioritizes intelligent discovery over social networking.**

### **The Solution**
SmartFolio is a professional platform that transforms static career documents into intelligent, conversational experiences. Users upload their resumes, portfolios, LinkedIn exports, and testimonials—SmartFolio's AI creates a comprehensive, queryable knowledge base about their professional background. Employers skip the endless scrolling and simply ask: *"Who has scaled a SaaS product from 0 to 1M users?"* or *"Find me a senior engineer who's led remote teams and knows our tech stack."*

### **How It Works**

**For Professionals:**
1. **Upload Everything**: Resume, portfolio, LinkedIn data, GitHub repos, recommendations, certifications
2. **AI Parsing**: Tiger MCP automatically extracts, structures, and enriches their professional data
3. **Living Profile**: Updates automatically as they add new achievements or projects
4. **Privacy Control**: Choose what's public, what requires permission, and what stays private

**For Employers:**
1. **Natural Language Search**: *"Show me backend engineers who've worked at startups and know PostgreSQL"*
2. **Conversational Deep Dives**: *"Tell me more about Sarah's experience with distributed systems"*
3. **Intelligent Matching**: AI understands intent beyond keywords—finding culture fits, not just skill matches
4. **Verified Information**: All claims linked to source documents and references
